# Hill_and_Valley_Prediction

**Overview**

The Hill and Valley Prediction Dataset is designed for training and evaluating algorithms that distinguish between hill and valley formations based on height measurements. This dataset is ideal for machine learning practitioners, data scientists, and researchers focusing on geographical and topographical data analysis.

**Dataset Contents**

**Files**

**Hill_Valley_Dataset.csv**: The main dataset containing height measurements and class labels.


**Structure**

The dataset consists of 1,212 instances, each with 100 features representing height measurements at various points in a landscape, and a class label indicating whether the instance represents a hill or a valley.

**Data Description**

**Attributes**

V1, V2, ..., V100: Height measurements at different points. Each attribute represents the height at a specific point in the landscape.
Class: The class label indicating whether the instance represents a hill (label = 1) or a valley (label = 0).

Example

V1	V2	...	V100	Class
39.02	36.49	...	39.10	0
1.83	1.71	...	1.69	1
68177.69	66138.42	...	74920.24	1
44889.06	39191.86	...	39615.19	0
5.70	5.40	...	5.91	0



**Statistical Summary**

The dataset includes a wide range of height values with significant variation, as shown by the summary statistics below:

**Count**: 1,212 instances
**Mean**: Varies significantly across features
**Standard Deviation**: Indicates a high variance in height measurements
**Minimum Value**: Lowest height measurement
**Maximum Value**: Highest height measurement



**Standardization of Features**
Standardization, also known as Z-score normalization, transforms the features such that they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This process ensures that each feature contributes equally to the analysis and improves the performance of many machine learning algorithms.
